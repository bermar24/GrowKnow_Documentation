# 1 Use-Case Name
Search & Filter Tools

## 1.1 Brief Description
A user can discover and narrow down the most popular AI tools. The user may enter a search term (tool name or keyword) and apply one or more filters to refine results. Each tool in the results can be expanded to show additional details and includes a link that redirects the user to the AI tool's external page.

# 2 Flow of Events
## 2.1 Basic Flow
- User navigates to the AI Tools listing page.
- User enters text in the search bar and presses Enter or selects a suggested term.
- System displays a list of tools matching the search term, ranked by relevance and optionally popularity.
- User applies filters (for example: category, rating, price range, platform, license).
- System updates the displayed list immediately (or after the user confirms) to reflect active filters.
- User expands a tool entry to view extended information (description, features, rating, tags).
- User clicks the tool's external link to open the AI tool in a new browser tab or window.
- If the user wants to reset the view, they clear the search input and/or reset filters to see the default list.

Feature: Search and filter AI tools

  As a user browsing AI tools
  I want to search by name or keyword and apply filters
  So that I can quickly find tools that match my needs and view more details before visiting the tool's site.
```

## 2.2 Alternative Flows
- No results found: If search and filters return no matches, the system displays a "no results" message and suggests popular categories or clears filters.
- Invalid filter combination: If selected filters are mutually exclusive or invalid, the system warns the user and prevents applying the combination.
- External link unavailable: If the target AI tool link fails to open, the system shows an error notice and logs the failure for diagnostics.
