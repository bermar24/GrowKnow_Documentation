## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes all specifications for the application "GrowKnow". It includes an overview of the project and its vision, detailed information about the planned features, and the boundary conditions of the development process.


### 1.2 Scope
The project is going to be realized as a web-based platform that consolidates current AI developments, organizes tools, and provides structured learning paths for IT professionals.

Actors of this platform can be Visitors, Registered Users, Admins, or the Automation Orchestrator (n8n). 
  
Planned Subsystems are: 

* AI News Feed & Newsletter:
At the core, an automated feed consolidates vetted AI sources. Articles are deduplicated, summarized, and tagged with metadata (source, date, relevance, use case). They are published on the platform and distributed through a weekly newsletter.

* AI Tool Directory:
A curated repository of AI tools, categorized by tasks (generate, analyze, automate, build, secure). Each tool includes metadata such as domains, alternatives, integration effort, and example workflows. Users can filter by goal, budget, and maturity.

* Role-Based Learning Roadmaps:
Roadmaps for roles like Data Engineer, ML Engineer, DevOps, or Security Engineer. Each roadmap includes ordered learning objectives, resources, and practice tasks.

* Account & Feedback System:
Registered users can subscribe to newsletters, suggest new tools/sources, and provide corrections.

* Administration & Data Pipelines:
Admins manage content review, user roles, and automation pipelines for ingestion, embeddings, and fact-checking. Automations (via n8n) handle crawling, newsletter generation, and triggers.

### 1.5 Overview
The following chapter provides an overview of this project with vision and Overall Use Case Diagram. The third chapter (Requirements Specification) delivers more details about the specific requirements in terms of functionality, usability and design parameters. Finally there is a chapter with supporting information. 
    
## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Vision
We aim to build a central hub for AI professionals. The platform consolidates AI news, organizes tools by utility, and offers structured learning roadmaps. The goals are:
* Provide orientation without noise.
* Support faster and more confident technology decisions.
* Enable measurable progress in AI/IT learning paths.

The system will be delivered iteratively:
1. MVP (by December): News feed, newsletter, tool search & filtering, and initial roadmaps.
2. Next phase: Expansion of the tool directory and roadmap coverage.
3. Later: More advanced feedback loops, contributor system, and extended automation.

### 2.3 Technology Stack
The technology we use is:

Frontend:

* React

Backend:
UseCaseDiagramCP.png

#### 3.1.13 Unsubscribe to Newsletter
Registered users can unsubscribe from receive the weekly newsletter.

### 3.2 Usability
We aim to design the GrowKnow platform with a clean, intuitive, and responsive interface. The user experience should feel natural, requiring no special training.

#### 3.2.1 No Training Time Needed
Users should be able to navigate the platform easily, discover tools, and subscribe without needing documentation.

#### 3.2.2 Familiar Feeling
By using standard UI/UX patterns, GrowKnow feels familiar to users accustomed to modern platforms, reducing friction in adoption.

### 3.3 Reliability

#### 3.3.1 Availability
The server shall be available 99% of the time. This also means we have to figure out the "rush hours" of our app because the downtime of the server is only tolerable when as few as possible players want to use the app.

#### 3.3.2 Defect Rate
Our goal is that we have no loss of any data.

### 3.4 Perfomance

#### 3.4.1 Capacity
The system should scale to handle thousands of concurrent visitors, with newsletter delivery supporting large mailing lists.

#### 3.4.2 Storage 
Stored data (tools, articles, feedback) should be optimized for efficiency without sacrificing accessibility.

#### 3.4.3 Response time
Pages and search queries should load within 1–2 seconds under normal load.

### 3.5 Supportability

#### 3.5.1 Coding Standards
We will follow industry best practices and clean code principles for both backend (Django) and frontend (React).

#### 3.5.2 Testing Strategy
The system will use automated testing for core functionalities (user registration, newsletter, search). Unit, integration, and pipeline tests will ensure reliability.

### 3.6 Design Constraints
* Modular architecture (frontend, backend, automation orchestrator).
* RESTful APIs for data exchange.
* Tech stack: React, Django, Supabase, n8n for automation.
