## ⚙️ Technology Stack  

- **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) → responsive, accessible UI for browsing news, tools, and roadmaps.  
- **Backend**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) & APIs → services, data processing, and integrations.  
- **Automations**: [n8n](https://n8n.io/) → workflows for crawling, tagging, summarization, and newsletter delivery.  
- **Database**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) → Postgres-based storage for unified schemas (news, tools, roadmaps).  
- **Search**: [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) / [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) → full-text search and filters.  

This stack is **automation-friendly, scalable, and developer-friendly**, supporting our MVP and future extensions.
