## 🚀 Core Features  

### 📢 AI News & Newsletter  
- Automated AI news feed powered by custom agents.  
- Duplicates removed, key points extracted, and tagged (source, date, relevance, industry/use case).  
- Weekly **compact newsletter** highlighting what changed and what is actionable.  
- **Transparency-first**: every claim links to the original source.  

### 🛠️ AI Tool Directory  
- A growing library of AI tools categorized by tasks (generate, analyze, automate, build, secure).  
- Ranked by **strengths, limits, and workflows**.  
- Filters for goal, budget, maturity, and integration effort.  
- Helps teams **choose faster and smarter**.  

### 📚 Role-Based IT Roadmaps  
- Roadmaps for **Data Engineer, ML Engineer, DevOps, Backend Engineer, Security Engineer**.  
- Structured sequence from **foundations to practice projects**.  
- Each step includes objectives, resources, and progress checks.  
- Makes required skills **visible, structured, and trackable**.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack  

- **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) → responsive, accessible UI for browsing news, tools, and roadmaps.  
- **Backend**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) & APIs → services, data processing, and integrations.  
- **Automations**: [n8n](https://n8n.io/) → workflows for crawling, tagging, summarization, and newsletter delivery.  
- **Database**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) → Postgres-based storage for unified schemas (news, tools, roadmaps).  
- **Search**: [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) / [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) → full-text search and filters.  

This stack is **automation-friendly, scalable, and developer-friendly**, supporting our MVP and future extensions.
